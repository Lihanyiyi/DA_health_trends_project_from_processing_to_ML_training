Applied Data Science Course Project from Milestone1-Milestone4, with Data processing, exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and ML model training. This a group project with other 3 members at NYUAD.

**This study explores the innovative use of Google search keywords as a predictive tool for estimating the prevalence rates of obesity and exercise behaviors. Leveraging various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, and Polynomial, and we developed a framework to analyze the relationship between search query frequencies and epidemiological trends (i.e., obesity and exercise rates). Our methodology involved extensive training and evaluation of these models to ensure accurate predictions. The performance of each model was rigorously assessed, highlighting the strengths and limitations inherent in different approaches. The results demonstrate a promising alignment between search keyword trends and actual prevalence rates, suggesting that Google searches can serve as a cost-effective and timely alternative to traditional demographic surveys. This research contributes to the field by offering an accessible method for health surveillance and public health policy planning, harnessing the ubiquity and immediacy of internet search data. Our findings underscore the potential of machine learning in public health analytics, opening avenues for real-time monitoring and proactive health management strategies.**
